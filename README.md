<h2>1. Asynchronous FIFO </h2> 
Designed an asynchronous FIFO of depth 2^n and relevent pointer synchronizing circuits in Verilog and verified its functionality. <br>

The design is greatly inspired from : http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2002SJ_FIFO1.pdf <br>
I found this blog also very helpful:  https://zipcpu.com/blog/2018/07/06/afifo.html

<h2>2. SPI Master </h2> 
Implemented SPI master which supports all 4 modes of SPI and verified functionality using Verilog.
